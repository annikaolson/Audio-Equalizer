# Audio-Equalizer---Digital-System-Design-Synthesis

This was a semester-long project for Digital System Design and Synthesis (ECE 551). We were provided some supplemental files, but designed the other components
such as the SPI, I2S interface, bluetooth interface, high/low frequency circular queues (using pointers similar to C), the FIR filters, PDM, bandscale, and analog to digital interface,
as well as other components on the DEO-Nano FPGA board.

I also wrote the synthesis script, and included the vg file with the netlist and the area report (~1000 larger than the professor's)

-> All files under "MainProjectFiles" are my own (not provided in class).
